# Recipe Generator
We have created a website to give users the opportunity to search ingredients, meal ideas, and/or food groups. The user will be provided with a detailed recipe and video pertaining to their search. After viewing the material displayed to them the user will be provided with a choice to save the recipe. When clicked the recipe will be saved onto another page for the user to view later. This way the user will never forget how to make their favorite recipe ever again!
